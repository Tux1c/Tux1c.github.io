        <h2>LGSS - Linux Game Saves Standard</h2>
        
        <p>So... As GNU/Linux gains more popularity in the gamin industry, we are facing a new problem - lack of organization in game saves.</p>
        <p>To fix that problem, I initially started the <a href="https://github.com/Tux1c/LGSO">LGSO</a> mini-project; it's a simple script that tries to inforce a unified save place for all the game saves. </p>
        <p>Now, I wish to make my proposal, (as it's the only sane one I've seen) into a standard, a standard that companies and indie devs will hopefully embrace, and make GNU/Linux a happier place.</p>
        
        <h3>So, what do you propose?</h3>
        <p>I propose to use ~/.local/share/games/game as a sane save location. Those who had set an XDG_DATA_HOME location, will obviously gain their respect and the location shall be XDG_DATA_HOME/game.</p>
        <p>I also propose to use ~/.config/game as a location for game configs.</p>
        <p>I chose those locations simply because ~/.local/share is a system-wide and widely-used location for storing stuff, and ~/.config is, likewise, a widely-used location to store configs.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, that's a great solution for the upgrowing issue with game saves. As nobody really had done anything against it, I propose my solution to that, as I am sick of having game save scattered on my home dir without any organization.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You are, obviously, free to propose your fixed and views on my site's <a href="https://github.com/Tux1c/Tux1c.github.io/">github project</a>, and I promise I will account them :).</p>
