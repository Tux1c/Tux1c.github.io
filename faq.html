        <p>Some people have asked me the same questions over an over, so I've decided to bundle them up here and save myself some time.</p>
        
        <h3>Why don't you make your website more stylish?</h3>
        <p>I see no reason in styling such a simple website. There is no need to bloat up a website that is simply a bunch of rants by myself and a few links.</p>
        <p>That ofcourse doesn't mean that I am against web designs or whatsoever, I'm just against adding unneeded bloat to stuff that don't need to be bloated.</p>

        <h3>Why do you think we care about your stupid website?</h3>
        <p>I don't. Even <b>I</b> don't care about my stupid website, this is merely a useful reference website and a place where I can store my rants on, as well as practicing my English and writing skills.</p>
        <p>If you are bored, or think you agree with my ideas, you are welcome to stay here.</p>
